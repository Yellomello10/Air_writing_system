# ✍️ Air Writing Recognition System

A real-time hand-tracking system that recognizes English alphabet characters drawn in the air using a webcam. This project leverages **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow** to detect hand motion and classify air-written letters.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time hand and finger tracking with MediaPipe
- Air-drawn letter recognition using CNN and image processing
- Visual feedback for detected strokes
- Pygame-based interface for display
- Flask server to serve recognition outputs (optional for web deployment)
- Achieves ~85% character classification accuracy
